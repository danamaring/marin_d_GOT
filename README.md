# Homework 4: GOT Video App
Use the in-class build and finish developing the application to the specs provided.


## Description

Add the final house sigils and video to your app; update the JS as required. Each sigil
image should trigger a side-scrolling animation. When the animation is complete, the
lightbox should open, containing the House video including custom controls. The lightbox
should close when the video reaches its end.

Show the related Great House information on the page, using an array to hold that data
and retrieving it when the banner animation is done. The heading should update as well,
and display the name of the current House.

Follow best practices as outlined in class when adding script and creating branches,
commits etc. Use a document outline and semantic tagging - remember that even though
we don’t specifically talk about those things, you’re expected to continue developing with
those tools.
